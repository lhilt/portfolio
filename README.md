# Lindsey Hiltner's Portfolio

## Technologies Used

* jQuery
* JavaScript
* SASS
* HTML

## Process/Approach

I began by looking for examples of other portfolios to get inspiration for my own design. After seeing others' ideas,
I chose a color theme that fit my personality and set to work laying the groundwork HTML. I worked on basic styling on the
entire page, then dove in on styling the project cards. Last was the JavaScript to highlight the navbar items.


## Biggest Wins and Challenges

The biggest win and challenge, simulataneously, was highlighting navbar items on scroll. After some extensive Stack
Overflow searching, I pieced together a few examples to make it work the way I wanted.
